\section des_pbl Description
The Hybrid EDMF scheme is a first-order turbulent transport scheme used for subgrid-scale vertical turbulent mixing in the PBL and above. It blends the traditional first-order approach that has been used and improved over the last several years with a more recent scheme that uses a mass-flux approach to calculate the countergradient diffusion terms.

The PBL scheme's main task is to calculate tendencies of temperature, moisture, and momentum due to vertical diffusion throughout the column (not just the PBL). The scheme is an amalgamation of decades of work, starting from the initial first-order PBL scheme of \cite troen_and_mahrt_1986, implemented according to \cite hong_and_pan_1996 and modified by \cite han_and_pan_2011 and \cite han_et_al_2015 to include top-down mixing due to stratocumulus layers from \cite lock_et_al_2000 and replacement of counter-gradient terms with a mass flux scheme according to \cite siebesma_et_al_2007 and \cite soares_et_al_2004. Recently, heating due to TKE dissipation was also added according to \cite han_et_al_2015.

The scheme works on a basic level by calculating background diffusion coefficients and updating them according to which processes are occurring in the column. The most important difference in diffusion coefficients occurs between those levels in the PBL and those above the PBL, so the PBL height calculation is of utmost importance. An initial estimate is calculated in a "predictor" step in order to calculate Monin-Obukhov similarity values and a corrector step recalculates the PBL height based on updated surface thermal characteristics. Using the PBL height and the similarity parameters, the diffusion coefficients are updated below the PBL top based on \cite hong_and_pan_1996 (including counter-gradient terms). Diffusion coefficients in the free troposphere (above the PBL top) are calculated according to \cite louis_1979 with updated Richardson number-dependent functions. If it is diagnosed that PBL top-down mixing is occurring according to \cite lock_et_al_2000 , then then diffusion coefficients are updated accordingly. Finally, for convective boundary layers (defined as when the Obukhov length exceeds a threshold), the counter-gradient terms are replaced using the mass flux scheme of \cite siebesma_et_al_2007 . In order to return time tendencies, a fully implicit solution is found using tridiagonal matrices, and time tendencies are "backed out." Before returning, the time tendency of temperature is updated to reflect heating due to TKE dissipation following \cite han_et_al_2015 .
