\section des_ozone  Description
 In recent years, the leading NWP centers have extended the vertical range of their NWP and DA systems
 from the surface up through the stratosphere (~10-50 km altitude) and lower mesosphere (~50-65 km). Some
 have also added stratospheric ozone (\f$O_3\f$) as a prognostic trace constituent to their models. Examples
 include the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
(\cite untch_et_al_1999; \cite dethof_and_holm_2004), and the NCEP GFS (NCEP 2003). The addition
 of stratospheric ozone as a prognostic variable is expected to improve overall forecast and analyses skill of other fields,
 such as temperature and wind. The primary reasons for this are:
 - more accurate assimilation of satellite radiances from channels that are sensitive to ozone 
  (\cite derber_and_wu_1998; \cite john_and_buehler_2004);
 - utilization of correlations between ozone and wind to improve wind analyses in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere
(UTLS) (e.g. \cite riishojgaard_1996); 
 - more accurate radiative heating rates, and hence temperatures arising from using analysed ozone rather than climatological
ozone in the forecast model radiation sheme (often referred to as "ozone/radiation interaction") (\cite jackson_and_saunders_2002); 
 - more accurate analyses and forecasts of surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
 
 With the extension of NWP/DA systems into the upper stratosphere, assimilation and advection alone cannot yield accurate ozone
 forecasts - photochemical effects must also be included. Due to the complexity of ozone photochemistry, it is not currently
 feasible to implement full ozone photochemistry within a high-resolution operational global NWP system. Instead, 
 the operational GFS currently parameterizes photochemical production and destruction based on 
 monthly mean coefficients provided by Naval Research Laboratory CHEM2D chemistry model through an ozone photochemistry parameterization (OPP),
 known as CHEM2D-OPP (\cite mccormack_et_al_2006). CHEM2D-OPP consists of four coefficients describing
 the residual ozone photochemical tendency as the difference between the production and loss rates \f$(P-L)\f$
 and its sensitivity to local changes in ozone mixing ratio \f$r\f$, temperature \f$T\f$, and overhead ozone column amount \f$\Sigma\f$ (see Figs. 1, 2, 
 5, and 6 in \cite mccormack_et_al_2006). The local time rate of change of ozone mixing ratio due to 
 photochemistry is then:
 \f[
  \frac{\partial r}{\partial t}=(P-L)\left[r,T,\Sigma\right]            
                                                                   \color{red} {(1)}
 \f]

 Linearization of the ozone photochemical tendency above has become a standard method for NWP and climate models. The latest 
 generation of linearized ozone photochemistry scheme approximate the unknown function \f$(P-L)\left[r,T,\Sigma\right]\f$ by 
 defining it about some reference state \f$r_0\f$,\f$T_0\f$,\f$\Sigma_0\f$, then expanding it about this reference state
 using a first-order Taylor series expansion.
 \f[
 \frac{\partial r(\lambda,\phi,p,t)}{\partial t}=(P-L)_0+\frac{\partial (P-L)}{\partial r}\bracevert_0(r-r_0)+\frac{\partial (P-L)}{\partial T}\bracevert_0(T-T_0)+\frac{\partial (P-L)}{\partial \Sigma}\bracevert_0(\Sigma-\Sigma_{0})           
                                                                   \color{red} {(2)}
 \f]
 where \f$\lambda\f$ represents longtitude, \f$\phi\f$ represents latitude, and \f$p\f$ represents pressure as the model 
 vertical coordinate. The subscript "0" attached to \f$(P-L)\f$ and its partial derivatives refers to their values
 at the reference state \f$r_0\f$,\f$T_0\f$,\f$\Sigma_0\f$, and are all zonally averaged quantities.
 The reference-state production and loss, \f$(P-L)_0\f$, and the various partial derivative terms about the state (the last 
 three terms on the right) are computed offline using CHEM2D model photochemistry. These coefficients are then stored in tabular 
 form as functions of latitude, pressure, and month, with suitable linear interpolation to the desired location (\c global_o3prdlos.f77).
 However, when implementing (2) in GFS physics suite, the perturbation terms \f$(r-r_0, T-T_0, \Sigma-\Sigma_0)\f$ are computed
 with respect to a zonal mean climatological reference state used to derive the partial derivatives in (2). such discrepancies
 can potentially introduce systematic, non-physical biases into the photochemical parameterization (\cite mccormack_et_al_2006).
