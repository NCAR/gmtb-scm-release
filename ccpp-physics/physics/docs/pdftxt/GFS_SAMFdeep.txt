\section des_deep Description
 The scale-aware mass-flux (SAMF) deep convection scheme is an
 updated version of the previous Simplified Arakawa-Schubert (SAS) scheme
 with scale and aerosol awareness and parameterizes the effect of deep
 convection on the environment (represented by the model state variables)
 in the following way. First, a simple cloud model is used to determine
 the change in model state variables due to one entraining/detraining cloud
 type, per unit cloud-base mass flux. Next, the total change in state variables
 is retrieved by determining the actual cloud base mass flux using the
 quasi-equilibrium assumption (for grid sizes larger than a threshold value
 [currently set to 8 km]) or a mean updraft velocity (for grid sizes smaller
 than the threshold value). With a scale-aware parameterization, the
 cloud mass flux decreases with increasing grid resolution. A simple
 aerosol-aware parameterization is employed, where rain conversion in
 the convective updraft is modified by aerosol number concentration.
 The name SAS is replaced with SAMF as for the smaller grid sizes,
 the parameterization does not use Arakawa-Schubert's quasi-equilibrium
 assumption any longer where the cloud work function (interpreted as
 entrainment-moderated convective available potential energy [CAPE])
 by the large scale dynamics is in balance with the consumption of the
 cloud work function by the convection.

 The SAS scheme uses the working concepts put forth 
 in \cite arakawa_and_schubert_1974 but includes modifications
 and simplifications from \cite grell_1993 such as saturated
 downdrafts and only one cloud type (the deepest possible), rather than
 a spectrum based on cloud top heights or assumed entrainment rates.
 The scheme was implemented for the GFS in 1995 by \cite pan_and_wu_1995, 
 with further modifications discussed in \cite han_and_pan_2011 , including the calculation
 of cloud top, a greater CFL-criterion-based maximum cloud base mass flux,
 updated cloud model entrainment and detrainment, improved convective
 transport of horizontal momentum, a more general triggering function,
 and the inclusion of convective overshooting.

 The SAMF scheme updates the SAS scheme with scale- and aerosol-aware
 parameterizations from \cite han_et_al_2017 based on
 the studies by \cite arakawa_and_wu_2013 and \cite grell_and_freitas_2014 for scale awareness
 and by \cite lim_2011 for aerosol awareness. The ratio of
 advective time to convective turnover time is also taken into account
 for the scale-aware parameterization. Along with the scale- and aerosol-aware
 parameterizations, more changes are made to the SAMF scheme. The cloud
 base mass-flux computation is modified to use convective turnover time
 as the convective adjustment time scale. The rain conversion rate is
 modified to decrease with decreasing air temperature above the freezing
 level. Convective inhibition in the sub-cloud layer is used as an additional
 trigger condition. Convective cloudiness is enhanced by considering suspended
 cloud condensate in the updraft. The lateral entrainment is also enhanced
 to more strongly suppress convection in a drier environment.
