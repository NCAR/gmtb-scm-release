\section des_shal Description
 The scale-aware mass-flux shallow  convection
 scheme (\ref SAMF_shal_main) is an updated version of the previous mass-flux shallow
 convection scheme with scale and aerosol awareness and
 parameterizes the effect of shallow convection on the environment.
 \ref SAMF_shal_main is similar to \ref GFS_mfdeep
 but with a few key differences. First, no quasi-equilibrium assumption
 is used for any grid size and the shallow cloud base mass flux is
 parameterized using a mean updraft velocity. Further, there are no
 convective downdrafts, the entrainment rate is greater than for deep
 convection, and the shallow convection is limited to not extend over
 the level where \f$p=0.7p_{sfc}\f$. The paramerization of scale and
 aerosol awareness follows that of the SAMF deep convection scheme,
 although it can be interpreted as only having the "static" and "feedback" control
 portions, since the "dynamic" control is not necessary to find the 
 cloud base mass flux. 


 The previous version of the shallow convection scheme (shalcnv.f)
 is described in \cite han_and_pan_2011 and differences
 between the shallow and deep convection schemes are presented in
 \cite han_and_pan_2011 and \cite han_et_al_2017 . 
 Details of scale- and aerosol-aware parameterizations
 are described in \cite han_et_al_2017 .
